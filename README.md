# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model is trained on a real-world diabetes dataset and uses patient health parameters to make predictions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that can be managed better with early detection.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can help predict diabetes based on medical input features.
